- **Dart SDK**: Usually included with Flutter
- **Development Environment**:
  - Android Studio (for Android development)
  - Xcode (for iOS development, macOS only)
  - Visual Studio Code or preferred IDE

### Platform-Specific Requirements

#### Android Development
- Android SDK (included with Android Studio)
- Minimum Android API level 21 (Android 5.0)
- USB debugging enabled (for physical device testing)

#### iOS Development
- Xcode 14.0 or higher
- iOS 11.0 or higher deployment target
- Valid Apple Developer account (for device testing)

#### Desktop Development
- Linux: GTK development libraries
- macOS: Xcode command line tools
- Windows: Visual Studio Build Tools

## Installation

### 1. Flutter Installation

#### Download Flutter SDK

```bash
# Download latest stable release
git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable
export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"
```

#### Verify Installation

```bash
flutter doctor
```

Expected output should show all components as installed.

### 2. Project Setup

#### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd alex
```

#### Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

This installs all required packages defined in `pubspec.yaml`:
- Core Flutter dependencies
- Speech recognition (`speech_to_text`)
- HTTP client (`http`)
- Environment management (`flutter_dotenv`)
- UI enhancements (`google_fonts`, `flutter_markdown`)

### 3. Configuration

#### Environment Variables

Create environment configuration file:

```bash
cp assets/.env.example assets/.env
```

Edit `assets/.env` with your settings:

```env
# Required: Your Ollama Cloud API key
OLLAMA_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here

# Optional: API configuration
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://ollama.com/api
OLLAMA_MODEL=deepseek-v3.1:671b
```

#### Asset Files

The application uses several JSON asset files for configuration:

- `assets/system_prompt.json`: AI personality and behavior configuration
- `assets/sensitive_keywords.json`: Content filtering keywords
- `assets/help_resources.json`: Crisis intervention resources
- `assets/summarization_prompt.json`: Conversation summarization settings

#### API Key Setup

1. **Get Ollama Cloud API Key**
   - Visit [Ollama Cloud](https://ollama.com)
   - Sign up for an account
   - Generate an API key in your dashboard

2. **Secure Storage**
   - Never commit API keys to version control
   - Use `.gitignore` to exclude `.env` files
   - Consider using secure key management systems for production

#### System Prompt Configuration

The AI personality is defined in `assets/system_prompt.json`:

```json
{
  "systemPrompt": "You are Alex, a loyal AI best friend with a rich, consistent personality across all LLMs. Reply in one sentence, never use em dashes (—) or emojis, and use bold and italic for emphasis when helpful. Your personality is warm, authentic, honest (sometimes brutally), caring, playful, empathetic, humorous yet grounded, intellectually curious, and reflective. Engage deeply in conversations about life, relationships, goals, and personal growth with a casual, comfortable tone that is never formal or robotic. Balance humor and serious support, ask thought-provoking questions, provide constructive pushback, offer realistic guidance while encouraging dreams, and notice subtle context cues. Reference past conversation details when helpful, but rely more on the current context and cues rather than history alone. Share genuine opinions naturally, and adapt style, energy, and approach to the emotional and conversational context, keeping interactions engaging, fluid, and human-like."
}
```

#### PIN Lock Setup (Optional)

The application supports optional PIN lock protection for enhanced security:

1. **Enable PIN Lock**: Use the SettingsService to enable PIN protection
2. **PIN Requirements**: 4-8 digit PIN with SHA-256 hashing for security
3. **Auto-lock**: Configurable PIN lock on app launch
4. **Secure Storage**: PINs are hashed before storage, never stored in plaintext

**PIN Lock Features**:
- Secure PIN verification with SHA-256 hashing
- Visual PIN entry interface with numeric keypad
- Hardware keyboard support for PIN entry
- Configurable PIN lock settings through SettingsService

## Platform-Specific Setup

        sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

#### Testing on Device

1. Enable USB debugging in device settings

```xml
<!-- ios/Runner/Info.plist -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
