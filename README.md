## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK**: Version 3.9.2 or higher
- **Ollama Cloud API Key**: Required for AI functionality
- **Microphone Permissions**: Required for speech recognition (mobile platforms)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd alex
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp assets/.env.example assets/.env
   ```

   Edit `assets/.env` with your configuration:
   ```env
   OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://ollama.com/api
   OLLAMA_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
   OLLAMA_MODEL=deepseek-v3.1:671b
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Platform-Specific Setup

#### Android
- Microphone permission is automatically requested on first use
- Ensure `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` includes microphone permission

#### iOS
- Add microphone usage description to `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:
  ```plist
  <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
  <string>This app needs microphone access for speech recognition.</string>
  ```

#### Linux
- Speech recognition may have limited support depending on distribution
- Platform-specific notifications are shown for unsupported features

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | Ollama Cloud API base URL | `https://ollama.com/api` | No |
| `OLLAMA_API_KEY` | Your Ollama Cloud API key | None | Yes |
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | AI model to use | `deepseek-v3.1:671b` | No |

> **💡 Recommendation**: We recommend using `deepseek-v3.1:671b` as your AI model for optimal performance and response quality. This model provides excellent context understanding and personality consistency for the Alex AI Companion experience.

### PIN Lock Security

The application supports optional PIN lock protection for enhanced security:

#### Setting up PIN Lock

1. **Enable PIN Lock**: Use the settings service to enable PIN protection
2. **PIN Requirements**: 4-8 digit PIN with SHA-256 hashing for security
3. **Auto-lock**: Configurable PIN lock on app launch

#### PIN Lock Features

- **Secure Storage**: PINs are hashed using SHA-256 before storage
- **Configurable**: Enable/disable PIN lock through settings
- **Graceful Degradation**: App functions normally when PIN lock is disabled
- **User-Friendly**: Clear prompts and error messages for PIN entry

### App Constants

Key configuration constants in `lib/constants/app_constants.dart`:

```dart
// Speech recognition settings
static const Duration speechListenDuration = Duration(seconds: 30);
static const Duration speechPauseDuration = Duration(seconds: 5);

// Conversation management
static const int summarizationThreshold = 10;
static const int summarizationUpdateThreshold = 25;
static const int maxMessagesForContext = 50;

// UI Configuration
static const double chatBubbleMaxWidth = 0.8;
static const EdgeInsets inputPadding = EdgeInsets.all(20);
```

## 📱 Usage

### Basic Chat
1. Launch the application
2. Type your message in the text field or use voice input
3. Press the send button or submit to send your message
4. Alex will respond with context-aware, personality-consistent replies

### Voice Input
1. Tap the microphone icon in the input field
2. Speak your message clearly
3. Tap the microphone icon again to stop recording
4. Your speech will be transcribed and sent automatically

### Conversation Management
- Conversations are automatically saved locally
- Long conversations are summarized for better context management
- Previous conversations are loaded on app restart

## 🤖 AI Integration

### Ollama Cloud API

The application integrates with Ollama Cloud API for AI responses:

- **Base URL**: Configurable via environment variables
- **Authentication**: Bearer token authentication
- **Model Selection**: Configurable AI model selection
- **Context Management**: Automatic conversation context inclusion

### System Prompt

Alex's personality is defined in `assets/system_prompt.json`:

```json
{
  "systemPrompt": "You are Alex, a loyal AI best friend with a rich, consistent personality across all LLMs. Reply in one sentence, never use em dashes (—) or emojis, and use bold and italic for emphasis when helpful. Your personality is warm, authentic, honest (sometimes brutally), caring, playful, empathetic, humorous yet grounded, intellectually curious, and reflective. Engage deeply in conversations about life, relationships, goals, and personal growth with a casual, comfortable tone that is never formal or robotic. Balance humor and serious support, ask thought-provoking questions, provide constructive pushback, offer realistic guidance while encouraging dreams, and notice subtle context cues. Reference past conversation details when helpful, but rely more on the current context and cues rather than history alone. Share genuine opinions naturally, and adapt style, energy, and approach to the emotional and conversational context, keeping interactions engaging, fluid, and human-like."
}
```

## 🎨 Theming

### Light Theme
- Clean, modern interface with subtle gradients
- Optimized for daytime usage
- High contrast for readability

### Dark Theme
- Easy on the eyes for low-light environments
- Consistent with system dark mode preferences
- Maintains all functionality with appropriate color adjustments
